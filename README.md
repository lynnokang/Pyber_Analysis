# Pyber_Analysis
#Overview:
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The analysis mainly  focused on creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

Results:
 Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary:
 Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
 A)There are significantly more rides in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural. Since the suburban and Rural areas are lacking drivers,Pyber may want to  look into investing in marketing the suburban and rural cities to urban drivers, since those cities   actually earn more.
 B)There can also be mini promortions to entice drivers to the suburban and rural cities.
 C). Implement a longer ride incentive program for the Suburban areas to increase total fare and possibly retain those drivers.
 there is more exploring that can be done for each City Type to understand usage peaks and dips and perhaps leverage such new analysis for a ride increasing program.
